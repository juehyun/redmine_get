### The benefit of this script
 - It is command-line tool (even it is using Chrome webdriver with selenium) so that you can download all redmine contents in batch mode.
 - There also exist python API for Redmine (https://python-redmine.com) but it needs help from Redmine server administrator to use the API.
 - This script using Chrome browser (i.e. access exactly same as using web browser) therefore, nothing to do with Redmine server administrator.
 - It is simply python script ! It can be used on Windows or Linux or ...
 - Mostly I use the script on Windows10

### The limitation
 - This script use Chrome web browser in headless mode (i.e. non-GUI)
 - This script parses received html source and analyze, and then send 'click' on a specified object ... and so on.
 - Therefore, if the Redmine page is differ from what the script expects ... The click will be failed.
 - Anyway, I use this script several years with my organization's Redmine server, It works perfect until so far.
